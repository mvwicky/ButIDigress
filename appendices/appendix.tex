None of these appendices are in any way \say{necessary.}
They're all useless in their own way.

Appendix~\ref{chap:roadtrip} is basically a journal which I updated every day (most days) while I drove across the country in the days after I graduated college.
It consists of an introductory entry and fifteen entries detailing one day of the trip.
Most entries are random thoughts I had that day, be they related to my locations or the artifacts of a raving lunatic.

Appendix~\ref{chap:justrandom}, entitled \say{Just Random Bullshit\ldots,} serves as, for the most part, a staging area for explorations which have yet to find a proper place in the main matter of the book.
