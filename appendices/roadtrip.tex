\chapter{Road Trip 2018}
\newpage
This is a log of my 2018 road trip from Boston to Santa Barbara.
Starting on May 16th, the trip as planned will take about two weeks and will span the country.

\section*{A Note to My Friends}\marginthought{Friend represents far too banal terminology}
I used to tell people, truthfully, that I couldn't remember the last time I had been truly happy.

Instead I created a simulation of happiness, a smiling facade over anguish.

All too often I ignored, or chose to be ignored by, those who would look upon my true face unflinching.

Not with strained eyes of pity, nor cold eyes of disdain, but with warmth and compassion and empathy.

Only once I learned to simply open the door to those knocking, who wished only the simple pleasure of my company, did I experience true happiness.

\hspace*{2em} It is you all, who lent me strength when I was weak, courage when I was afraid, a smile when all I wanted to do was cry.

\hspace*{2em} For so much that I have, my life, my joy, I thank all of you.

\margintodo{move all this out of here and into the blog}

\section{The Night Before}\margintime{11}{30}{PM}
I'm sitting here before my computer, nervous about the upcoming trip.
Well, not the trip necessarily, I'm excited about that, it's more the fact that I feel like I have so much to do tomorrow.

\section{May 16: Boston to Burlington}
Lying in bed.\margintime{6}{45}{AM}
More accurately, lying on my mattress, on the floor of my stressfully non-empty room.
Looking around I know that all evidence of me has to be completely gone by, like, noon, and I don't have a clear exit strategy for a lot of it.
For example, the current object of my repose, even a twin mattress is a fairly substantial thing of which to dispose.

In a weird way I'm not all that worried.

\entryskip

\margintime{10}{00}{AM}Just dropped off my last package at Fedex, now all I have to do is clean up and pack up the car.
First, however, I'm gonna take a little break (clearly, I'm writing this), sip my tea, and just wake up a little more.
It seems quite unfathomable that I'm gonna drive like four goddamn hours later today, but that's the way it is.

\entryskip

\margintime{6}{39}{PM}
I did end up driving like four goddamn hours.

Said four-ish hours\margincomm{More like three and a half} ended abruptly, when I tried to stop at a red light.
I heard a popping, banging sound from my car\ftnote{Always fun to hear.}, and then when I tried to start driving again, there were some dope grinding noises.
Luckily, and seriously, this whole situation is unbelievably fortuitous, there was a repair place within walking distance, and they picked up my car, diagnosed it, and are in the process of fixing it\ftnote{It was a broken CV-joint for the record.}.

While waiting for my car to get picked up, I made a reservation at a hotel (where I am currently) two miles from the repair place.
Moseying on back to the shop, I picked up my laptop, backpack, toiletries, and a change of clothes.
Being a smart person, I called an Uber to my hotel, is what I would have said if I were a smart person, instead I walked the two miles, in flip-flops, with my bags, after a long day already.

I don't know how I thought my first day of driving would go.
But not once did I envision walking across an overpass.

\section{May 17: Burlington to Ithaca}
\margintime{7}{50}{AM}It's weird how accustomed to things one's body can be.
Like, having slept in a twin bed my entire life, even the double that I slept in last night feels needlessly, luxuriously gargantuan.

Not feeling a whole lot of motivation to leave right now, but I must, must get breakfast, must get car.

Estimated drive time for today: six-ish hours\ldots

One last thought, the experience of writing everyday, or doing this actual journaling thing has been interesting.
Normally writing for me is like, synthesizing a whole mess of life experience down into something more abstract, applicable to a variety of situations.
The relative normality of this is strange, but I also feel like writing consistently, not just when the mood strikes, is the key to becoming a better writer\ftnote{Which I want to become.}.

\entryskip

\margintime{10}{21}{AM}Just finished breakfast and am sitting in the same coffee shop that I went to yesterday\ftnote{\textit{Uncommon Grounds}}.
Now I have to wait roughly an hour for my car to finished getting fixed.

As I was walking back from breakfast\ftnote{At \textit{Handy's Lunch}, which was a pretty cool small town diner type place, like, the waitress said \say{thanks for finding us} when I left.}, I had a thought argument\ftnote{Super Stefon voice: it's that thing when you have an argument with an imaginary person in your head to help prove a point to yourself.} about this, my, generation.
To be fair, I am at kinda the head of this generation, the actual group is the people just younger than me who grew up fully immersed in the World Wide Web.
Popular conceptions of this `Internet generation' seem to show it as self-centered, with heads buried in phones, and totally oblivious.
I could not disagree with the characterization more; this is honestly, an absurdly empathetic group of people.

Take, as an easy example, the rising enforcement of `PC' language; how is this anything but a profound empathetic response to the plight of the disparate?
For a cis-het (\textit{inter alia}) person to actively champion non-binary, `non-traditional' language is remarkable.

Also, about the phone thing, it's not like we're staring at our goddamn reflections, we're connecting with the world.

\entryskip

\margintime{7}{20}{PM}A pretty arduous day of driving done.

\entryskip

\margintime{8}{26}{PM}Bit of a false alarm there, took a shower and shaved.
Anyways, the day got started late, the mechanic took longer than I anticipated and there wasn't a clear time table.
So I walked around Burlington, well, I say around but I essentially walked in circles and slowly got more and more stressed.
I left around 1:30PM, which sucked; I was tired and freaking out a bit so the drive wasn't that great either.

An additional annoying element to leaving late was the inability to stop anywhere to take pictures.

My hotel in Ithaca\ftnote{Where I am right now.} is no where near anything, not that I have the desire to go outside and do stuff right now.
Although I probably will end up running to Wegmans.

\section{May 18: Ithaca to Detroit}
\margintime{8}{06}{AM}Not much to report, Kate McKinnon is hilarious.

\margintime{5}{47}{PM} I seem to have a knack for choosing non-centrally located hotels, cause this one is near nothing.\margincomm{also this one specifically is pretty clearly primarily used for extended stay}

The drive through Canada was pretty boring, a lot like a drive through the US\@.
Except for the road signs being in kilometers and the highway being named after a monarch.

Coming back into the US was kinda weird though.
Being me, I was awkward with the border, immigration, whatever dude, which I'm guessing perturbed him.
Kinda expounded a bit too much I think on the whole trip and was vague and mumbly about where I came from and where I was going and why I was in Canada in the first place.
So asks to look in the trunk and goes to open the back door, so I was slow on the draw there and then the dog comes over and, even though there was nothing bad in the car, you're still nervous.
Obviously I was let through, but the level of scrutiny was weird.

Grimes + Elon Musk is a topic I spent some time working on in my head during the drive.
I've expressed my displeasure in their particular relationship\ftnote{Obviously, she's allowed to do whatever the hell she wants and if she's happy that's great.}, most of my animus is centered around Elon.

My dislike of him is really centered around two problems, one of which is common to people who run large businesses and the other is not really of his making.
First, in management v.\ labor, I pretty much unequivocally come down on the side of the latter, so his unfair labor practices irk me.
As mentioned, this is common in industry, that doesn't make it okay, but it's not like he's special in that regard.

People who like Elon Musk, seem to \emph{really} like him.
I am inherently distrustful of anyone held up as a messianic, savior-like figure.
Not his fault, I know, but it still freaks me out.

\section{\ May 19: Detroit to Columbus}
\margintime{3}{34}{PM}Dateline Columbus: forgot entirely to write this morning which kinda sucks, but\ftnote{Haha, sucks butt.} now I'm in the first city I was really dying to visit.\margincomm{if you don't know why I'm so excited, go ahead and watch the movie \movie{Columbus}, it's great}
Anyways, fine drive today\ldots

\entryskip

\margintime{9}{15}{PM}Columbus was exactly what I expected in the best way.
It really was just a mid-western sleepy town with some awesome architecture.

Actually, I liked it so much, or I do like it so much, that I'm extending my stay here by a day.
I am, however, moving to a new hotel, because this one sucks and is dirty.
Cheap tho.

\section{May 20: Columbus}
\margintime{10}{29}{AM}Woke up way late, but it doesn't really matter, cause I'm not going anywhere today.

\entryskip

\margintime{11}{22}{AM}Sitting in the courtyard of the Columbus courthouse, I feel like this is what politicians refer to when they say that liberals don't understand `real' America.
Like, this is not a typical midwest city, but I get the feeling that this place voted about 65\% for Trump.\margincomm{I looked up and Bartholomew County, i.e., this county, voted 63.7\% for Trump, so not that far off}
At the same time, I feel like I could live here, it's quiet, interesting, and oddly fascinating.
Maybe my day here will show me something new.

I sometimes can't tell if people are actually looking at me funny or if it's just a projection of my general anxiety.
But, I am out of place here, being a coastal, college educated, elite.

I've been thinking about that, the fact that I grew up on a coast, went to school on another coast, and am now moving back to the coast.
It makes me feel like this trip, while well meaning\ftnote{For whatever that's worth.} is a bit condescending.
(Or, you know, super condescending.)

\section{May 21: Columbus to Milwaukee}
\margintime{8}{25}{AM}Excited to go see some baseball today.

\entryskip

\margintime{3}{19}{PM}Note that the date is now in Central Time.

Just showed up in Milwaukee, unfortunately, the check in time is 4:00 PM at my hotel.
So I'm just sitting in my car for a little bit waiting for four.

I walked around Marquette University for a little bit, pretty alright looking campus.
A lot of nice looking universities/other institutions are, I imagine, a result of building in a place where the largest expenditure isn't land, like it is in Boston or San Francisco or somewhere coastal or somewhere more \say{desirable.}

\section{May 22: Milwaukee to Minneapolis}
\margintime{8}{55}{AM}Quite tired.

Anyways, now I'm gonna write some stuff down and it's gonna go really well.

That Film Crit Hulk column on \href{http://observer.com/2018/05/the-two-crucial-filmmaking-elements-causing-all-your-movie-feuds/}{\say{text versus texture}} has really got me thinking.
Like, the epistemological question of \say{why do I like this?} is pretty much constant whenever I find myself enjoying something.
For instance, I was watching \tvshow{iZombie} right before writing this, and now I'm just trying to parse out, what, specifically, I like about the show.

(I'm not gonna provide any explanation at this juncture.
But, know that I'm struggling.)

\entryskip

\margintime{3}{59}{PM}Just showered and shaved in my Minneapolis hotel room, which is like a pretty dope studio type thing.

Excited for more baseball tonight.
Looks like a pretty quick drive tomorrow, to Fargo.

Cheating a bit here\ftnote{B/c formatting.} and writing post-Minneapolis.

It was fun watching live baseball, Target field is pretty nice, I left early, but I was pretty okay with it.
Even if the Dodgers aren't exactly amazing right now, I still like to watch them.

\section{May 23: Minneapolis to Fargo}
\margintime{1}{28}{PM}Full disclosure, I'm not actually staying in Fargo, I'm actually not even staying in North Dakota.
But, since Fargo is so close to the border, I'm staying like fifteen minutes away, in Moorhead, Minnesota.\ftnote{I'm gonna keep referring to my location as Fargo.}

\section{\ May 24: Fargo to Teddy Roosevelt Nat'l Park}
\margintime{8}{30}{AM}Going to my first National Park.

\entryskip

\margintime{5}{29}{PM}Another time zone change, now I'm in Mountain Time.

It would be reductive and, frankly, insulting to call Theodore Roosevelt National Park \say{beautiful.}

\section{May 25: Teddy Roosevelt Nat'l Park to Yellowstone}
\margintime{8}{23}{AM}Second National Park today.
Excited for this one, not that I wasn't excited for Teddy, b/c I feel like this is one that lives up to expectations.

\entryskip

\margintime{3}{45}{PM}Cody, Wyoming.
Still trying to figure out if I should go see Yellowstone stuff today.
I can either do that stuff today, or tomorrow.\margincomm{this seems obvious}
I'm tired right now, but tomorrow I have a long drive.
Such a quandary.

I'm leaning towards tomorrow, because I'm not exactly itching to do a bunch of stuff in Salt Lake City, could get a late start and just show up late.

\margintime{7}{52}{PM}Yup, tomorrow it is.

So I've been watching \tvshow{Parks and Rec} and there are so many elements that I find somewhat problematic.
First, Aziz Ansari, for obvious reasons.
Additionally, in watching the \textit{Partridge} episode, there are so many damn \book{Infinite Jest} references.

\section{May 26: Yellowstone to Salt Lake City}
\margintime{7}{25}{AM}

\entryskip

\margintime{8}{06}{AM}Waaaaaayyy too tired to write anything in that first thing.
Still tired, but excited to see some Yellowstone ish today.

This trip is really starting to wear me down.
That extra day in Columbus honestly may have saved my gd life.
Like, I want to go check out Yellowstone, but I am so beat.
It's one thing just being tired, but this is something different; driving is so annoyingly tiring.

You're sitting, for hours, and then you're exhausted, with nothing physical to show for it.

\entryskip

\margintime{6}{05}{PM}Ugh

\section{May 28: Salt Lake City to Grand-Staircase Escalante}

\margintime{9}{33}{AM}Gosh dang, \tvshow{The 100} is an awesome show.
What presented itself as a pretty standard young-adult show\ftnote{As in like, the first episode was pretty vanilla.} is actually a super intense drama.
For example, in the third (?) episode of the fourth season, I saw a child die in her parents arms, of radiation poisoning; she took her last breaths, her breathing slowed until it stopped, her parents went from comforting to breaking down.
That's not some young-adult bs, that's for real.

I do really hate the Jasper character.
He's kinda an embodiment of postmodern, existentialism not caring about the world, that resignation to the universe's lack of regard for human life and morality.
I recognize that the universe does not have a modicum of regard for us\ftnote{It can't it's inanimate, but the point is we're insignificant.} but that does not, in my opinion, make my life meaningless.
In fact, choosing to live my life by a moral code is a more noble choice, laughing in the face of the unknowable void is bravery.
Succumbing to hopelessness, resigning oneself to a life free of morals or restraint is cowardly.\margincomm{this whole part will probably end up in the \emph{The Void} section}

I have been a fan of the show's interplay between faith and science.
Clarke, generally, represents science, or pragmatism, she takes the practical solution, as hard as it may be.
Jaha on the other hand, represents faith, he believes in long shots, maintaining hope, leading people to salvation through his beliefs.
The show does a great job of showing that we need both.

Being pragmatic is important, but sometimes hope is the only way out.

\entryskip

\margintime{2}{57}{PM}

\entryskip

\margintime{3}{43}{PM}Thought a lot about the Id, Ego, and Superego on the drive.
Also thought a lot about explaining shit to people.
I feel like I may have a decent ability to put concepts in more understandable terms.
I also enjoy talking about things in terms of engineering/science/mathematical concepts.
Maybe I should write down my explanations\ldots

\section{May 28: Grand-Staircase Escalante to Great Basin Nat'l Park}
\margintime{4}{26}{PM}Couldn't really think of anything to write this morning besides more stuff about \tvshow{The 100}\ftnote{Which I wrote down in my journal, for later transcription.}

Anyways, pretty quick drive today, only like three-ish hours.
I went on a hike in Great Basin National Park, it was great.
Took a bunch\ftnote{For me.} of pictures.

But now I'm in my \say{hotel.}
I use the quotes because it is like no hotel to which I've ever been.
Also I have no cell service, and the WiFi here is super spotty.

\entryskip

\margintime{5}{33}{PM}Normally I wouldn't make a skip between these two entries, but I am fickle and capricious.
So there also isn't a desk here, I'm writing this on the couch, with the laptop on my lap.

Additional heads up, not so sure about these timestamps, because they use Pacific time here, but my phone isn't updating because no cell service.
So they're adjusted to PDT.

\section{May 29: Great Basin Nat'l Park to Death Valley Nat'l Park}
\margintime{8}{00}{AM}Second to last, or last really, leg of this trip.
As kinda a terrible person once said: \say{Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.}

\section{May 30: Death Valley Nat'l Park to Santa Barbara}
\margintime{8}{07}{AM}Just getting ready to leave.
Excited for a short drive today.

This trip has been fun, but next time I'd like to maybe do fewer days, or stay at each location longer.
I like road trips, but this was a bit excessive, or like, too short in a weird way.
