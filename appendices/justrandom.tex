\section{Random Thoughts on Speech}
Our (humanity's) ability to describe is, as far as is currently known, unique amongst animals.
Other species, most or all of them, have the ability to speak, some form of language exists.
However, they deal purely within the scope of the prescriptive.
They don't recall.
They don't tell they're friends what they did the preceding day.
We do.

Not only do we flap our gums (and twirl our pens) regarding things that have happened, we communicate ideas and concepts that have no basis in reality (hot take, e.g., religion). In \book{Sapiens}, it is asserted that this ability is our most fundamental property, what renders \emph{Homo sapiens} alone alongside all other animals.
It has been found, independently (I think, haven't checked) that \emph{Homo sapiens'} superlative pattern recognition (superior pattern processing) is a foundational element of language.

An anecdote, from Barthes: Karl von Frisch, sought to prove the commonly held hypothesis that bees had some form of language.
He succeeded in this pursuit, but found that their language contained no description, it was all prescriptive; they had to coordinate in order to get their food, they didn't talk about what they were doing or had done, if such information was not imminently necessary for survival.
Basically, we're the only animals that talk about shit that doesn't really matter/exist.
