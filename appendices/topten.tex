\chapter{Top Ten Lists}
\newpage

This is gimmicky, but I felt like I should write these down somewhere.\marginthought{also, I'm a fuckin' hack.}
\section{Movies}\label{sec:moviestopten}
\margintodo{figure out 3 and 4}The top two here are rock solid\ftnote{Note they're tied for first.}, but the rest can mostly be shuffled around.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] \textbf{\movie{Short Term 12}} --- A beautiful, intimate film\ldots\marginthought{gonna be honest, starting to think of \movie{Short Term 12} more as the leader, just feel more of a connection to it (\texttt{6/7/18})}
    \item[1.] \textbf{\movie{Speed Racer}} --- This movie encapsulates perfectly the idea of sincerity. Made with the usual brick-to-the-face subtlety of the Waichowskis, it is so true to itself that it is, in my opinion, impossible not to love.
    \item[3.]
    \item[4.]
    \item[5.] \textbf{\movie{Mad Max: Fury Road}} --- Technically brilliant. Manages to pack a powerful story within a striking and kinetic film. Also Charlize Theron is incredible and an inspiration.
    \item[6.] \textbf{\movie{No Country for Old Men}} --- Within the Coen Brothers' pantheon, this is at the top. A poignant exploration of what it means to grow old and the cruelty of man\ldots
    \item[7.] \textbf{\movie{Detention}} --- Just bizarre\ldots a pretty intense amalgamation of just about every nineties film you can imagine.
    \item[8.] \textbf{\movie{Good Night, And Good Luck}} --- I'm a sucker for stories about journalists, and this one is great. Shot in black and white, it deals with a tumultuous period of US history.
    \item[9.] \textbf{\movie{Columbus}} --- Beautifully shot, this film is small like \movie{Short Term 12}, but, like that movie, packs a powerful story. The movie with the most \say{frame-able} scenes.
    \item[10.] \textbf{\movie{Hunt for the Wilderpeople}} --- An unorthodox coming-of-age film, Taika Waititi is a comedic master, he crafts a wonderfully sincere and intimate story of connection and adventure.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Honorable Mentions}

\section{TV Shows}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] \textbf{\tvshow{The West Wing}} --- The pretty easy favorite. Partially due to the liberal fantasy of it all, partially from the snappy Aaron Sorkin dialog, and partially for the struggle of getting through season five.
    \item[2.] \textbf{\tvshow{Brooklyn Nine-Nine}} --- \ldots
    \item[2.] \textbf{\tvshow{Parks and Recreation}}
    \item[4.] \textbf{\tvshow{Breaking Bad}}
    \item[5.] \textbf{\tvshow{The Good Place}}
    \item[6.] \textbf{\tvshow{The Office (US)}}
    \item[7.] \textbf{\tvshow{Legion}}
    \item[8.] \textbf{\tvshow{The 100}}
    \item[9.] \textbf{\tvshow{BoJack Horseman}}
    \item[10.] \textbf{\tvshow{iZombie}}
\end{itemize}
