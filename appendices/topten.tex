\chapter{Top Ten Lists}\label{chap:topten}
\newpage

This is gimmicky, but I felt like I should write these down somewhere.\marginthought{Also, I'm a fuckin' hack.}
I've created like forty different versions of my top ten movies list, but this is going to be the definitive one.

\section{Movies}\label{sec:moviestopten}
The top two here are rock solid\ftnote{Note they're tied for first. Well, \movie{Short Term 12} is starting to pull ahead in my mind, I haven't really thought out why, so the order remains for now.}, but the rest can mostly be shuffled around.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] \textbf{\movie{Short Term 12}} --- A beautiful, intimate film\ldots\marginthought{gonna be honest, starting to think of \movie{Short Term 12} more as the leader, just feel more of a connection to it (\texttt{6/7/18})}
    \item[1.] \textbf{\movie{Speed Racer}} --- This movie encapsulates perfectly the idea of sincerity. Made with the usual brick-to-the-face subtlety of the Waichowskis, it is so true to itself that it is, in my opinion, impossible not to love.
    \item[3.]\foottodo{figure out 3}
    \item[4.] \textbf{\movie{Swiss Army Man}}
    \item[5.] \textbf{\movie{Mad Max: Fury Road}} --- Technically brilliant. Manages to pack a powerful story within a striking and kinetic film. Also Charlize Theron is incredible and an inspiration.
    \item[6.] \textbf{\movie{No Country for Old Men}} --- Within the Coen Brothers' pantheon, this is at the top. A poignant exploration of what it means to grow old and the cruelty of man\ldots
    \item[7.] \textbf{\movie{Detention}} --- Just bizarre\ldots a pretty intense amalgamation of just about every nineties film you can imagine.
    \item[8.] \textbf{\movie{Good Night, And Good Luck}} --- I'm a sucker for stories about journalists, and this one is great. Shot in black and white, it deals with a tumultuous period of US history.
    \item[9.] \textbf{\movie{Columbus}} --- Beautifully shot, this film is small like \movie{Short Term 12}, but, like that movie, packs a powerful story. The movie with the highest percentage of \say{frame-able} scenes, i.e., the most scenes, or individual shots which I would like to frame and hang up on my wall.
    \item[10.] \textbf{\movie{Hunt for the Wilderpeople}} --- An unorthodox and delightful coming-of-age film. Taika Waititi cements himself as a comedic master (in my mind at least), he crafts a wonderfully sincere and intimate story of connection and adventure.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Honorable Mentions}

\section{TV Shows}\label{sec:tvshowstopten}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] \textbf{\tvshow{The West Wing}} --- The pretty easy favorite. Partially due to the liberal fantasy of it all, partially from the snappy Aaron Sorkin dialog, and partially for the struggle of getting through season five.
    \item[2.] \textbf{\tvshow{Brooklyn Nine-Nine}} --- Started off as just really funny, and has evolved into a truly heartfelt show which truly has something to say about inter-human relationships. And has remained absurdly funny.
    \item[2.] \textbf{\tvshow{Parks and Recreation}} --- Like \tvshow{Brooklyn Nine-Nine}, \tvshow{Parks and Rec} has much to say about our relationships, in this case, specifically about those formed between people who are dissimilar to ourselves. Can be heart-achingly sincere, funny, and politically relevant all at the same time.
    \item[4.] \textbf{\tvshow{Breaking Bad}} --- One of the greatest stories ever to be told on television; a tragic and thrilling saga showing a good man turn towards his darkest impulses. Masterful performances by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul and everyone in between.
    \item[5.] \textbf{\tvshow{The Good Place}}
    \item[6.] \textbf{\tvshow{The Office (US)}}
    \item[7.] \textbf{\tvshow{Legion}}
    \item[8.] \textbf{\tvshow{The 100}}
    \item[9.] \textbf{\tvshow{BoJack Horseman}}
    \item[10.] \textbf{\tvshow{iZombie}}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Honorable Mentions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\tvshow{Game of Thrones}}, \textbf{\tvshow{Westworld}} --- It feels appropriate to put these two together, both shows that I really, really enjoy, but on a popcorn level. I've had a good time and good times with both of them, but neither has really emotionally hit my life in and of itself.
\end{itemize}
