My personal philosophy type thing, basically a bunch of Latex files

I compiled the book successfully using LuaLatex with a full installation of TexLive 2017 using the LatexTools plugin for Sublime Text 3.

# General Style Guide
## Margin Notes
- Red/Bold: TODO notes, indicate something that I want to change or further expound
- Blue/Small Caps: Commentary notes, some thought or further elucidation on a subject
- Green-ish/inner: Date notes, (when I remember to put them) when I created/edited that section
- Yellow/Italic: Random thoughts

# TODO
- [ ] Clean up language generally
- [ ] Add the margin notes explanations to the book
- [ ] Start doing releases of the pdf
- [ ] Add the pdf to the .gitignore
- [ ] Move discussions of _The 100_ to the proper section
- [ ] Find all the times where I use quotations marks and change them to the `\say` command
- [ ] Make or find a hat that says "pedant" or "pedantic" across the front
