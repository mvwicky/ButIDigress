My personal philosophy type thing, basically a bunch of LaTeX files

I compiled the book successfully using LuaLatex with a full installation of TexLive 2017 using the LatexTools plugin for Sublime Text 3.

# General Style Guide
## Margin Notes
- Red/Bold: TODO notes, indicate something that I want to change or further expound
- Blue/Small Caps: Commentary notes, some thought or further elucidation on a subject
- Green-ish/inner: Date notes, (when I remember to put them) when I created/edited that section
- Yellow/Italic: Random thoughts

# TODO
- [ ] Clean up language generally
- [x] Add the margin notes explanations to the book
- [x] Start doing releases of the pdf
- [x] Add the pdf to the .gitignore
- [ ] Move discussions of _The 100_ to the proper section
- [x] Find all the times where I use quotations marks and change them to the `\say` command
- [ ] Make or find a hat that says "pedant" or "pedantic" across the front
- [x] Use the `\movie` and `\tvshow` and `\book` commands (and make more as appropriate)
- [ ] Maybe add a sections breakdown to the beginning of each chapter
- [x] Copy over existing release notes to CHANGELOG.md
- [x] Change `wc.py` to `digress.py` or something like that, scope has expanded beyond word counts 
- [ ] Generally increase footnote length
- [ ] research
