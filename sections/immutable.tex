Complaining, expressing one's discontent, is not only natural, but essential.
This does not enjoin complaints generally, but only when they are \emph{against what one cannot affect}.

I'd just like to take a moment here to talk about the quote at the head of this chapter.
The search for this quote took a long, long time, like, a truly disturbing amount of time.

\section{Corollary: The Mutable}
Arising naturally (or not, I have really no idea what people ever mean when they say that) from the previous item, one should not complain (about the mutable) without \emph{attempting to effect change}.
I have found this hard to put into practice, as I am naturally quite averse to going outside and/or expending energy.

\section{What is Immutable?}
We all goddamn complain.
