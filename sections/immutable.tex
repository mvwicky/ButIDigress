\newpage
\margintodo{my thoughts on this are strained, b/c I don't necessarily accept absolutes, but also apparently I can stomach immutability? maybe this is more like a day-to-day thing, whereas the other thing is more philosophical/existential}
Complaining, expressing one's discontent, is not only natural, but essential.
This does not enjoin complaints generally, but only when they are \emph{against what one cannot affect}.

I'd just like to take a moment here to talk about the quote at the head of this chapter.\margindate{5/1/2018}
The search for this quote took a long, long, long-ass time, like, a truly disturbing amount of time.
For quite a while it simply said \say{Some quote}, attributed to \say{Some person.}
Phillip K. Dick, for those who don't know, was a prolific science-fiction writer, particularly notable for the number of movie/television adaptations of his work; he wrote \textit{Total Recall} and \textit{Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?}, which was adapted into \movie{Blade Runner}.
His \textit{bona fides} are stated to show that he has some experience in world building, in constructing realities.
I chose this quote, I like this quote, because, obviously, it represents the spirit of this chapter; it also ties into, reminds me, of concepts from \textit{Objectivity}.

\section{Identifying Immutability}
As will be explored later on, in the chapter on knowledge (\fref{chap:knowledge} starting on page \pageref{chap:knowledge}), I don't really believe in absolute truths, i.e., absolute knowledge about anything.
So how, one may ask, can I posit that any situation is fully unchangeable?
The answer lies in scope and in consequence.

\section{Corollary: The Mutable}
Arising naturally\footnote{or not, I have really no idea what people ever mean when they say that} from the concepts outlined above, one should not complain (about the mutable) without \emph{attempting to effect change}.
I have found this hard to put into practice, as I am naturally quite averse to going outside and/or expending energy.
