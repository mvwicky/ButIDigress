\lettrine{A}{s} with any endeavor, there have been specific moments in this writing that were more difficult than others.
But, as is so often the case, from this pain comes inspiration.
In my writing, I was quite often constrained by the format I had chosen; splitting this work into monolithic-seeming chapters limited my ability to present thoughts which stemmed from multiple concepts.
Such concepts tend to be the most important.

\digsec{On Rationality and Morality}{7}{17}{18}{rationalityandmorality}
There's a scene in the recent film \movie{Sorry to Bother You} (directed by Boots Riley, 2012) in which the antagonist\ftnote{Played by the excellent Armie Hammer.} explains to the protagonist\ftnote{Played by the similarly excellent Lakeith Stanfield} his plot.
Said plot is certifiably batshit, but as a coda, he adds an assurance of rationality, \say{I'm just trying to show you that I'm not insane,} or something to that effect.
In a strange, fucked-up way, he's right, there is no step in his plan that is necessarily truly irrational, every step is fairly \say{logical,} but his final conclusion is demented.

I bring up this scene specifically because I've recently started to really notice how much in today's society is sacrificed at the altar of rationality.
