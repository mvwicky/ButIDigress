If you can't think of where to start, start at the beginning.
I'd like to think of that as sage advice, but one just runs into another problem: where does anything even \enquote{begin?}

\begin{somenotes}{Flow}
    \item Need to re-title this chapter/section\lips
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \enquote{Ideatic Flow} was something I came up with so I had something to write
        \item I want something that captures the same idea, something like \enquote{Stream of Consciousness,} but like, original
        \item Think I got it, maybe
    \end{itemize}
\end{somenotes}
