If you can't think of where to start, start at the beginning.
I'd like to think of that as sage advice, but one just runs into another problem: where does anything even \enquote{begin?}
The canonical starting point that I've always used has been my first year at Northeastern, but that's not necessarily entirely appropriate.
If we're talking about when my depression \enquote{started,}\ftnote{To show its face at least.} then I guess it'd be my last couple years of high school.

But taking a more causal approach, do I start at my birth?
But the events leading to my current situation started long before that\lips, do I start when my ancestors moved to America?
But events in their homelands still affect my life, clearly.
We can follow the chain of causality \textit{ad nauseam}.
So do I start at the big bang?
That certainly fills me with \textit{nauseam}.

You know what?
I think will actually start there, I brought it up for the sake of hyperbole, but it represents the cleanest point of entry.

Somewhere around \num{13.799+-0.021} billion years ago,\autocite[32]{planckcollab} space and time began, with the Big Bang.
Soon after,\ftnote{Like on the order of \SI{e-33}{\second} later} the four fundamental forces of the Standard Model\ftnote{Strong, Weak, Electromagnetic, and Gravitation} emerged.
Three hundred and eighty thousand years after that,\ftnote{In that \num[group-separator={,}]{380000} years, the universe cooled down, allowing quarks to go from a quark-gluon plasma to forming hadrons, antimatter was annihilated, and neutrinos stopped interacting with normal matter} electrons started binding to atomic nuclei.\ftnote{Which came into existence earlier, but it was too hot for electrons to bind to nuclei.}
Over one and a half million years later, stars started forming.

Then I was born, about thirteen billion years after the Big Bang.

    \item Need to re-title this chapter/section\lips
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \enquote{Ideatic Flow} was something I came up with so I had something to write
        \item I want something that captures the same idea, something like \enquote{Stream of Consciousness,} but like, original
        \item Think I got it, maybe
